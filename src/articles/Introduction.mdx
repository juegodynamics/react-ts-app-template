# Introduction
Welcome, fearless explorer, to a universe where imagination is your most potent tool, and adventure is but a dice roll away. In a Tales of the Nyxi adventure, you’ll play in a boundless world. Set in an alternate timeline Earth working alongside a mystical alien civilization, the adventures here aim to take you into the depths and the heights that you’ve never explored before. Imagine having the ability to visit a place before the universe, or the birthplace of consciousness, and what you might do with that experience in worlds with seemingly insurmountable physical and cultural challenges. 

If you've never embarked on the fantastical journey of a tabletop role-playing game (RPG), fret not. This guide is your compass to navigating the enthralling realms of the Tales of the Nyxi.

## What is a Tabletop RPG?
At its core, a tabletop RPG is a narrative-driven game where players take on the roles of characters in a story, navigating challenges, forming alliances, and influencing the unfolding tale through their choices. Unlike video games, where visuals and coded logic dictate the experience, a tabletop RPG relies on spoken narrative, imaginative collaboration, and the randomness of dice to shape the world and events.

## Getting Started: The Basics
1. The Dimension Master (DM): One person assumes the role of the Dimension Master. They are the storytellers, the world-builders, the adjudicators of rules, and the puppeteers for non-player characters. In Tales of the Nyxi, the DM will guide you through bustling Astral Bazaars, introduce you to unexplored realms, and set challenges in your path.
2. The Players: The rest of the group will play as individual characters, each with their own backstory, skills, and motivations. These characters are the protagonists of the story, and their decisions will shape its outcome.
3. Character Sheets: Each player has a character sheet, a document detailing everything about their character — from their physical attributes to their acquired skills and personal history. This sheet is a reference for the player and the DM throughout the game.
4. Dice: The unpredictability in tabletop RPGs often comes from dice rolls. Want to charm an Atlantean merchant or navigate a treacherous Nyxi cloud continent? Roll the dice to determine the outcome. Tales of the Nyxi primarily uses a set of polyhedral dice, with different numbers of sides to determine outcomes of various magnitudes. However, there is also a special set of dice called the Realm Dice which have irregular shapes and are used for special actions throughout the journey.
5. Setting and Story: Using the world and history described in this guidebook, the DM will set scenes, present challenges, and introduce characters that players will interact with. Players will then describe their actions and reactions, weaving their own subplot into the larger tapestry of the Tales of the Nyxi.

Your First Game
1. Preparation: Begin with a session where players create their characters, deciding on their backstories, attributes, and goals. The DM will also provide an overview of the current state of Terra and Nyx, setting the stage for the adventure.
2. Narration: Once the game begins, the DM narrates the setting and situation, placing the characters into the world. "You find yourselves in a bustling Astral Bazaar, where a Nyxi merchant beckons you over to examine a curious gadget..."
3. Player Actions: Players describe what they want their characters to do. This can be anything from conversing with the Nyxi merchant to examining the surroundings.
4. Outcome Determination: Many actions will require a dice roll to determine their outcome. The DM will guide players on which dice to roll and interpret the results.
5. Advancing the Story: With each player decision and dice outcome, the story moves forward. It might lead to unexpected alliances, thrilling battles, complex realm exploration, or intriguing mysteries based on the intertwined narratives of the DM and players.

Remember, in Tales of the Nyxi, there's no right or wrong way to play. The goal is collective storytelling, creating memorable experiences, driving philosophical discussions, and embarking on epic adventures in a universe where two worlds converge with the unknown. Embrace the journey, and let your imagination soar!
